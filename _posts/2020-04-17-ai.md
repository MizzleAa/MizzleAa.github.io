Parsing JSON with Ruby is actually extremely easy. All you have to do is have the json gem installed (`gem install json`) and call the `JSON.parse` method on the JSON data to convert it to ruby hashes. If you look at this small program here, you can see how I have implemented parsing JSON in Ruby.

{% highlight python %}
print("Test")
{% endhighlight %}
